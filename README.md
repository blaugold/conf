`conf` is a Dart package for defining configuration schemas and loading
configuration values from from multiple sources, such as:

- command line arguments
- environment variables
- JSON string from command line arguments or environment variables
- JSON files
- YAML files

Sources override each other in a specific order, that can be configured.
